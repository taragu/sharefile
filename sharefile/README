The program contains two part: Server and Client. 
They should be run separately.

To start the server, type <./Server port> in the console. The port here should be a specific number. A number between 2000 to 10000 is suggested yet not limited.

To start the client, type <./Client IP port> in the console. The IP here is the server's IP. Port should be the one that is define when you started the server.

Once both server and client are started, you can either login or register an user. When a user is creater, there will be a directory under the user's name both in server and client. In client's console, you are browsing your directory in server and you can only upload the files in your directory in client. So if you want to upload a file, first put it in your directory in client and then upload.

Commands are as followed:

get <filename>	     DOWNLOAD FILE
help		     SHOW GUIDANCE
put <filename>	     UPLOAD FILE
ls  		     LIST FILES IN CURRENT DIRECTORY
lsf 		     SHOW LIST OF FRIENDS
lsm		     SHOW LIST OF MESSAGES
send username msg    SEND MESSAGE OR FRIEND REQUEST
cd <directory>	     SWITCH DIRECTORY
share filename user  SHARE FILE TO A SPECIFIC USER
rm filename    	     ROMOVE FILE

NOTES:
Commands that we usually used in terminal don't work here, which means you can do <cd ~> because <~> is not parsed in our code. Rule of thumb, only use the command that are listed aboved.
